## Virtual Keyboard

Virtual keyboard is an application that lets you type on a virtual keyboard using the Leap Motion Controller with the Skeletal Tracking system. Currently this project is a proof of concept to test the feasibility of a virtual keyboard. The virtual keyboard works but a phsyical keyboard is more desired for typing. This virtual keyboard is a step towards virtual reality inputs and it will be the future of tomorrow.
